# Car-Insurance-Safe-Driving
The device we created was inspired by how some insurance companies are unable to tell which of their drivers are safe and which are not due to not having enough data on their drivers. We created this device to gather data on drivers based on their level of aggression when on the road.
<br><br>The main.py file imports the audio and accelerometer classes to help make it more readable. These helper classes handle audio out and manage the acceleration values and conversions.
